## Usage

 1. Clone the repository.
 2. Navigate to the downloaded files.
 3. Run main.py.

## Usage example

When running the tool for the first time it's recommended to start with generating some tokens to later check. After choosing the 1st module (Generator) you will be asked to input the number of Token Loops (1 Token Loop = 5 Tokens of different types). The generated tokens will automatically be saved in the current directory.
To actually get into the account, we need to check for the token's validity. This is where the Checker module comes in handy, where you will be asked to give the number of threads and timeout, and also select the token file to check. 
For the best experience use <200 threads and 5-10 timeout. (Prevents getting your IP rate limited)
